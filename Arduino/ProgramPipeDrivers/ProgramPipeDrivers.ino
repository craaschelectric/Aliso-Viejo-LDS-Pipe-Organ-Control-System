/* Program pipe drivers
 *  The serial interface also allows for programming of the Pipe Driver boards.  This is not normally be done by the console controller, but will be done by a PC or specialty device.  
 *  The process is as follows:
1)  Host sends An command. n=number of bytes to follow
    Byte order after An is BoardMSB  BoardLSB  Address(bit 7=0 for write, 1 for read)  n bytes of data (if Write)
2) Addressed device sends an En array, n=number of bytes to follow.  Byte order after En is BoardMSB  BoardLSB  Address(bit 7=0 for write, 1 for read)  n bytes of data (if Read)
3) Host sends 0xFE (Ack)

A pipe driver board contains up to 32 blocks of data, indicating up to 32 ways that those 25 notes can be driven.  The block contains
  Start bit – indicates which bit in the keyboard field is the start of the stop
  End bit – indicates which bit in the keyboard field is the end of the stop
  Gate bit – indicates which bit in the STOP field turns this stop on
  AND gate – if this block is acting on a coupler, indicates the bit in the stop field of the coupler
  NAND gate – indicates the bit in the stop field of the UnisonOff for this stop. 1FF if not used
EEPROM configuration.  PIC18F46K42 has 1K of EEPROM, 4K data RAM
              0= Board Address MSB
              1= Board Address LSB
              2= Number of valid blocks (Up to 32)
              6= Validity signal for EEPROM, if EEPROM is valid, =0x5A
              7= Validity signal for EEPROM, if EEPROM is valid, =0x96
           Configuration blocks (n starts at 1)
              8n+0 = Block Config
                  Bit 0 = bit 9 of Start field
                  Bit 1 = bit 9 of End field
                  Bit 2 = bit 9 of Gate field
                  Bit 3 = bit 9 of And field
                  Bit 4 = bit 9 of Nand field
                  Bit 7 = 1=Coupler 0=Stop
              8n+1 = Start bit - 512 bit number of the Keyboard bit to start the pipe drivers. This always maps to PIPE01
              8n+2 = End bit - 512 bit number of the Keyboard bit to end the pipe drivers
              8n+3 = 256 bit Offset from keyboard
              8n+4 = Gate bit - 512 bit number of the Stop bit to gate on. This reflects the stop in question
              8n+5 = AND gate - 512 bit number of the Stop bit to AND with the gate bit. Used when the Coupler bit =1
              8n+6 = NAND gate - 512 bit number of the Stop bit to NAND with the gate.  Used for Unison Off. Set to 0x1FF if not used.
